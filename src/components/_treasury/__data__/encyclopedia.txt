As of 2022 the national deficit of the UK stands at around one trillion. In 1999 the deficit
was zero. A deficit is zero when government spending is the same amount as government revenue,
which is most through taxation.

A country is in deficit when government spending is more than revenue. If annual revenue
was £10 and annual spending was £15 pounds, the deficit would be £5. If revenue was £15 and
spending was £10, the government would be in a surplus of £5.

A long term deficit is when the accumulated deficit of previous years has not been matched
by revenue. If last years deficit was £5 and this years deficit was zero, the long term
deficit would still be £5, even though this years deficit was nothing.
