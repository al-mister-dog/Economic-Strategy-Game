    objective: "The interest rate (or bank rate) is the interest rate that banks and lenders pay when they borrow from the Bank of England. It influences most interest rates, including savings accounts, credit cards, loans and mortgages. Usually mortgage rates go up or down quite soon after the base rate changes. The inflation target is currently set at %2. If the inflation rate is above this number it may be wise to set the interest rate higher.",

    "The rate that the Central Bank willl charge other banks and financial institutions for loans with a maturity of 1 day.",
    inflationRate: "The total increase percentage of prices in the Consumer Product Index (CPI). Click INFLATION tab for more details.",
    inflationTarget: "An expected rise in inflation can motivate consumers to spend more now to avoid future price increases. This can boost growth.",

    cpiWeight: "The weights are based on the relative importance of the product to households –  for example, if a household spends 8% of their income on chocolate, and 25% on transport, the weights would be 8 and 25 respectively. However this is usually an estimate by economists. At moments of structural change, it is the weighting schemes that are used to construct price indices that come under pressure. Price index numbers are based on the assumption that the proportion of spending on food, clothing, housing, travel etc remain relatively constant over time. Statisticians face a dilemma as to whether to hold the share of different goods in the consumption basket constant, or whether to adjust to the new circumstances. Transport spending is down, whereas other goods and services are up. Unsurprisingly, the prices for transport services are rising less fast than for everything else. If you adjust the weights to downgrade the lower level of spending on travel, you produce a higher inflation number."
